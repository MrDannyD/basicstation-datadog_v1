# Datadog IoT Agent + Kerberos.io on balenaCloud

A sample repo that shows how to use Datadog IoT Agent in combination with another application, for monitoring device metrics.

You do need a Datadog API Key, so, ensure you have signed up for an account with them and grabbed your API Key as outlined in their Docs here:  https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/agent/#configuration

Then in balenaCloud, create an Environment Variable with that information, using the name `DATADOG_API_KEY` and the value of the key.
